# Implement Swagger for existing Express-NodeJs projects and not die trying

## Intro
Let's get start explaining what is [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) and why will need it.
### Swagger, what is it?

Let's suppose we have to start to write a new server side as part of a freelance project, let's say a simple web API with some few endpoints.
Once we finish our code, we pass it to the client. Once he got our code, he immediately will ask us for a documentation in order to
consume our API.

A developer may write the best API service, but without the proper documentation, it wouldn't be fully functional.
Here is where Swagger come into play.

Swagger is an Open-Source framework that help us to write better documentation to our RESTful APIs. It's supported by many programming languages, also it implements a UI that make us easier the task of visualize our documentation. In the simplest words, we can be writing
our code at the same time that we are creating the proper documentation.

If we decide to implement Swagger in our development cycle, these are some of the benefits we will get:
- Our RESTful APIs will be simple to use right out of the box
- Swagger will solve our needs of documentation at client and server side, also it will solve our testing sandbox needs.
- It comes with an open-sourced front end, which quickly allows us to work with the API.
